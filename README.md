# Facemask-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project implements and compares six different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for facemask detection using the "Face Mask Dataset" from Kaggle. The models include VGG16, VGG19, a custom CNN, ConvNeXtTiny, ResNet101, and ResNet152. Among these, VGG19 showed the best performance.
